        <p>
          For a long time I have wanted an electric bike. So I made one. It uses
          Arduino Uno as micro processor, motor controller (IBT_2), Motorcycle
          Battery (MTX20-BS, AGM), Vevor motor (Model BY1016Z) and a cheap
          potentiometer for speed control. The motor and controller were
          installed using a wooden frame. For the bike frame I used some old
          Helkama bike which I found somewhere.

            <h3>Microprocessor</h3>
            <p>
              For the microprosessor I used basic Arduino Uno. It is easy to
              code and I had few of those laying around at my room.
              Unfortunately this project needed two Arduinos because I somehow
              managed to break one. But Arduino is little bit overkill but it
              was the easiest.

              takes up to 24 volts.

            <p>
              I needed to buy a new chain to my bike because the Helkamas
              original chain was too thin for the gear in the motor
